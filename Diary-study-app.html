        <p class="normal">This was a design challenge I was given to apply to a UX design position in 
            September 2018. Therefore, this was a solo ride that included: user research, early concepts, 
            wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and iteration.

    <div class="padding3">
    <p class="normal">I started this challenge with the following question: is an app really the solution? 
        Of course, I would have ended up designing the app because it was a challenge for a job position, 
        but true user experience design should always start with the question: what does the user wants? 
        What does the user needs? I believe just because things can be built, this does not mean they should 
        if you do not have the right reasons to do so. If users are not going to use your product or do not needed, 
        why build it in the first place? </p>

        <p class="normal">After narrowing down the problem, and choosing the domain. I conducted a diary study, and gave the participants 
            the freedom to choose the best medium to log their entries (This way I could accomplish two goals in one task: 
            ux research for the app and to confirm the need for a diary study app or to suggest a different approach). Therefore, 
            I  told the participants they could use a piece of paper and send a picture of their write-up, text message or any other 
            form they seemed appropriate for the study or convenient for them. I intentionally did not set up boundaries to see what 
            they come up with. I will expand on this later on.</p>
