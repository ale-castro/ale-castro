        <p class="normal spacing1">This was a design challenge I was given to apply to a UX design position in 
            September 2018. Therefore, this was a solo ride that included: user research, early concepts, 
            wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and iteration.

        <h2>Is an app the right solution?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="normal spacing2">I started this challenge with the following question: is an app really the solution? 
        Of course, I would have ended up designing the app because it was a challenge for a job position, 
        but true user experience design should always start with the question: what does the user wants? 
        What does the user needs? I believe just because things can be built, this does not mean they should 
        if you do not have the right reasons to do so. If users are not going to use your product or do not needed, 
        why build it in the first place? </p>
