        <p class="normal">This was a design challenge I was given to apply to a UX design position in 
            September 2018. Therefore, this was a solo ride that included: user research, early concepts, 
            wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and iteration.

        <h2>Is an app the right solution?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="padding3">
    <p class="normal">I started this challenge with the following question: 
        <span class="italic-light">is an app really the solution?</span>
        Of course, I would have ended up designing the app because it was a challenge for a job position, 
        but true user experience design should always start with the question: what does the user wants? 
        What does the user needs? I believe just because things can be built, this does not mean they should 
        if you do not have the 
        <span class="italic-bold"> right reasons</span> 
        to do so. If users are not going to use your product or do not needed, 
        why build it in the first place? </p>

            <div class="padding4">
                <p class="normal">After narrowing down the problem, and choosing the domain. 
                <span class="italic-bold">conducted a diary study, and gave the participants 
                the freedom to choose the best medium to log their entries</span>
                (This way I could accomplish two goals in one task: 
                ux research for the app and to confirm the need for a diary study app or to suggest a different approach). Therefore, 
                I  told the participants they could use a piece of paper and send a picture of their write-up, text message or any other 
                form they seemed appropriate for the study or convenient for them. I intentionally did not set up boundaries to see what 
                they come up with. I will expand on this later on.
                </p>
            </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Narrowing Down</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>
       <div class="padding3">
    <p class="normal"> Based on previous experiences, I learned that the best way to tackle this type of challenges 
        is to set the rules clearly and be specify about the domain, so that I do not end up going down the rabbit hole and wasting precious time. 
        There are several ways to approach the prompt: one is to come up with a tool that can be used for any diary study (keeping it generic), 
        which means a CMS for the researcher needs to be added. Another approach is to choose a specific domain/use case. I decided to go with the 
        second option in order to get participants to respond to my diary study more easily. I selected a topic anyone can relate to: food. After all 
        everybody needs to eat, right? Around eating we developed habits and diary studies are great for uncovering this data. I decided to go with a 
        diary study app for a food preparation company. </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Assumptions</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>
    <div class="rounded-box">
    <p class="normal padding5"> A food prep service company would like to enhance their meal plans by accommodating people with special diets (due to allergies, medical conditions,
         and personal preferences), that might become in potential customers. The company wants to understand/know more about their diet habits to determine 
         possible expansion.</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="flex-rules">
            <div class="list1">
                <p class="smaller">A user researcher needs to identify the needs and motivations of food preferences of potential customers . In doing so, they/she/he need/s to gather the following information:</p>
                <li class="smaller">How often the participant cooks their own meals or buys prepared food (for instance, going to a restaurant, food bars at supermarkets etc.). The ones who buy more often instead of cooking could be potential customers.</li>
                <li class="smaller">Frequent/repeated behaviors when it comes to food choices.</li>
                <li class="smaller">Common ingredients in their meals (to help the company optimize its kitchen and supply chain processes).</li>
                <li class="smaller">What participants do vs what participants say.</li>
                <li class="smaller">Since a diary study is a “long-term” commitment participants of the study will get financially compensated</li>
            </div>

    </div>
    

    <h1>Recruiting of Participants</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>
    <div class="flex-users">
        <p class="normal">I recruited 3 participants and asked them to record what they eat in a day (a minimum of two entries was requested). To recruit the participants I asked several people beforehand if 
        they have any special diet. This was done remotely.</p>
            <img src="Images/participants-description.svg" alt="a graphical representation of 3 participants and their demographics">
        </div>

    <h1>Diary Study Prompt</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>

    <div class="prompt">
        <p class="smaller padding1">
            Please record what you eat during a day. A minimum of two entries is required, one meal is one entry. 
            You can record/send me the entries in any medium you want (text messages, pictures of write-ups, emails, etc.) 
            If you choose to write things down on a piece of paper all you need is to send me a picture of it. If possible, 
            please take pictures of the meals you have.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-two-col">
        <p class="smaller">
            The reason I left the prompt open-ended was to find out what were participants preferred mediums. 
            I wanted to see if there was a strong preference for write-ups or not. How they would respond to it: 
            whether they would do something unexpected. By giving participants a lot of room of interpretation it 
            allowed me to identify key features the app should have. 
        </p>
         <p class="smaller">
            Also, I needed to know how far participants would go doing this unpaid activity (they were all working 
            professionals with busy schedules). My assumption was: if busy people can do it without getting paid, 
            paid participants in a real study can do the same and even go a little further with the tasks and extra 
            app features if useful for the study.

    <h1>Insights</h1>

    <div class="insights">
        <p class="normal">All of them compiled their entries and reported all at once with text/email. Two of them choose text messages.</p>
        <li class="normal">No one send a picture of handwritten notes.</li>
        <li class="normal">One participant used pictures to exemplify what she ate.</li>
        <li class="normal">Two of the participants (both females) were very descriptive with their entries in their own ways.</li>
        <li class="normal">Male participant responded with simple words such as “Lunch: I had a salad.”</li>
        <li class="normal">Two participants did provide clear clues about their lifestyle and believes (they preferred to cook and 
            have wholesome foods) which makes a diary study a powerful tool for this type of investigation.</li>

    <h1>Design Implications</h1>

            <p class="giant">1</p>
            <div class="texto">
                <p class="smaller">
                    “Lunch: I have a salad” is not really enough information, but if a picture would have come along with this comment, 
                    it would be a significant entry. From a picture a researcher might infer whether the salad was bought or homemade, 
                    inconstancies, patterns, preferences, etc.
                    <span class="sm-bold-under">
                        Pictures or even short videos
                    </span>
                    provide rich information in this particular use case and compensate the rush of some participants to make an entry. 
                    Also, one participant did provide pictures even when this activity was unpaid which also suggests that paid participants 
                    can do it too.

                    Although how insightful for a researcher a diary study is, this types of studies disrupt participants lives, 
                    and often the entries might be seen as  
                    <span class="italight-under"> 
                        an interruption or extra work
                    </span>(one participant procrastinated the task until the next day). 
                    That is why diary studies typically last no more than one month and are compensated. This means that the way users provide feedback 
                    has to be quick so they can move on with their lives easily. This is translated into 
                    <span class="sm-bold-under">
                    few steps/screens.</span> 
                    This was evident with the “Lunch: I have a salad” response.

                    ALL of the participants sent their answers at once, suggesting they wanted to get the task at hand done right away
                    <span class="sm-bold-under"> 
                    with very few interruptions   
                    </span> . That implies that the number of entries has to be limited somehow. I am assuming that the researcher with a minimum of 2 
                    entries and a maximum of 3, will have enough information, so I gave the users to option to enter just the main meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the design part of this challenge.

                    No edits after submitting an entry  
                    </span>
                    If users is provided with the option of editing after making an entry, they might start overthinking what is being said or shown and unintentionally, they might "curate" the information 
                    altering the raw data. Especially after seeing one participant describing even the ounces of food eaten which suggest a very detail oriented person. This is also aligned with the previous idea about making entries fast and easy.

                <p class="smaller">
                Since all of the participants typed their answers, and 2 out 3 did it in detail, this builds a strong case to support a feature where participants can type longer responses and supply additional information/context.
