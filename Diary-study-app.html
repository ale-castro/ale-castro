        <h2>Is an app the right solution?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="padding3">
    <p class="normal">I started this challenge with the following question: 
        <span class="italic-light">is an app really the solution?</span>
        Of course, I would have ended up designing the app because it was a challenge for a job position, 
        but true user experience design should always start with the question: what does the user wants? 
        What does the user needs? I believe just because things can be built, this does not mean they should 
        if you do not have the 
        <span class="italic-bold"> right reasons</span> 
        to do so. If users are not going to use your product or do not needed, 
        why build it in the first place? </p>

            <div class="padding4">
                <p class="normal">After narrowing down the problem, and choosing the domain. 
                <span class="italic-bold">conducted a diary study, and gave the participants 
                the freedom to choose the best medium to log their entries</span>
                (This way I could accomplish two goals in one task: 
                ux research for the app and to confirm the need for a diary study app or to suggest a different approach). Therefore, 
                I  told the participants they could use a piece of paper and send a picture of their write-up, text message or any other 
                form they seemed appropriate for the study or convenient for them. I intentionally did not set up boundaries to see what 
                they come up with. I will expand on this later on.
                </p>
            </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Narrowing Down</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>
       <div class="padding3">
    <p class="normal"> Based on previous experiences, I learned that the best way to tackle this type of challenges 
        is to set the rules clearly and be specify about the domain, so that I do not end up going down the rabbit hole and wasting precious time. 
        There are several ways to approach the prompt: one is to come up with a tool that can be used for any diary study (keeping it generic), 
        which means a CMS for the researcher needs to be added. Another approach is to choose a specific domain/use case. I decided to go with the 
        second option in order to get participants to respond to my diary study more easily. I selected a topic anyone can relate to: food. After all 
        everybody needs to eat, right? Around eating we developed habits and diary studies are great for uncovering this data. I decided to go with a 
        diary study app for a food preparation company. </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Assumptions</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>
    <div class="rounded-box">
    <p class="normal padding5"> A food prep service company would like to enhance their meal plans by accommodating people with special diets (due to allergies, medical conditions,
         and personal preferences), that might become in potential customers. The company wants to understand/know more about their diet habits to determine 
         possible expansion.</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="flex-rules">
            <div class="list1">
                <p class="smaller">A user researcher needs to identify the needs and motivations of food preferences of potential customers . In doing so, they/she/he need/s to gather the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> How often the participant cooks their own meals or buys prepared food (for instance, going to a restaurant, food bars at supermarkets etc.). The ones who buy more often instead of cooking could be potential customers.</li>
                    <li> Frequent/repeated behaviors when it comes to food choices.</li>
                    <li> Common ingredients in their meals (to help the company optimize its kitchen and supply chain processes).</li>
                    <li> What participants do vs what participants say.</li>
                    <li> Since a diary study is a “long-term” commitment participants of the study will get financially compensated</li>
                </ul>    
            </div>
            <img src="Images/salad.svg" alt="picture of a delicious salad in a blue plate">
    </div>
    

    <h1>Recruiting of Participants</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>
    <div class="flex-users">
        <p class="normal">I recruited 3 participants and asked them to record what they eat in a day (a minimum of two entries was requested). To recruit the participants I asked several people beforehand if 
        they have any special diet. This was done remotely.</p>
            <img src="Images/participants-description.svg" alt="a graphical representation of 3 participants and their demographics">
        </div>

    <h1>Diary Study Prompt</h1>
    <div class="line3"></div>

    <div class="prompt">
        <p class="smaller padding1">
            Please record what you eat during a day. A minimum of two entries is required, one meal is one entry. 
            You can record/send me the entries in any medium you want (text messages, pictures of write-ups, emails, etc.) 
            If you choose to write things down on a piece of paper all you need is to send me a picture of it. If possible, 
            please take pictures of the meals you have.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-two-col">
        <p class="smaller">
            The reason I left the prompt open-ended was to find out what were participants preferred mediums. 
            I wanted to see if there was a strong preference for write-ups or not. How they would respond to it: 
            whether they would do something unexpected. By giving participants a lot of room of interpretation it 
            allowed me to identify key features the app should have. 
        </p>
         <p class="smaller">
            Also, I needed to know how far participants would go doing this unpaid activity (they were all working 
            professionals with busy schedules). My assumption was: if busy people can do it without getting paid, 
            paid participants in a real study can do the same and even go a little further with the tasks and extra 
            app features if useful for the study.

        <li class="normal">One participant used pictures to exemplify what she ate.</li>

        <li class="normal">Male participant responded with simple words such as “Lunch: I had a salad.”</li>
        <li class="normal">Two participants did provide clear clues about their lifestyle and believes (they preferred to cook and 
            have wholesome foods) which makes a diary study a powerful tool for this type of investigation.</li>

                    “Lunch: I have a salad” is not really enough information, but if a picture would have come along with this comment, 
                    it would be a significant entry. From a picture a researcher might infer whether the salad was bought or homemade, 
                    inconstancies, patterns, preferences, etc.
                    <span class="sm-bold-under">
                        Pictures or even short videos
                    </span>
                    provide rich information in this particular use case and compensate the rush of some participants to make an entry. 
                    Also, one participant did provide pictures even when this activity was unpaid which also suggests that paid participants 
                    can do it too.

                    Although how insightful for a researcher a diary study is, this types of studies disrupt participants lives, 
                    and often the entries might be seen as  
                    <span class="italight-under"> 
                        an interruption or extra work
                    </span>(one participant procrastinated the task until the next day). 
                    That is why diary studies typically last no more than one month and are compensated. This means that the way users provide feedback 
                    has to be quick so they can move on with their lives easily. This is translated into 
                    <span class="sm-bold-under">
                    few steps/screens.</span> 
                    This was evident with the “Lunch: I have a salad” response.

                    ALL of the participants sent their answers at once, suggesting they wanted to get the task at hand done right away

                    with very few interruptions   
                    </span> . That implies that the number of entries has to be limited somehow. I am assuming that the researcher with a minimum of 2 
                    entries and a maximum of 3, will have enough information, so I gave the users to option to enter just the main meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the design part of this challenge.

                    If users is provided with the option of editing after making an entry, they might start overthinking what is being said or shown and unintentionally, they might "curate" the information 
                    altering the raw data. Especially after seeing one participant describing even the ounces of food eaten which suggest a very detail oriented person. This is also aligned with the previous idea about making entries fast and easy.

                Since all of the participants typed their answers, and 2 out 3 did it in detail, this builds a strong case to support a feature where participants can type longer responses and supply additional information/context.

                    but the experiment failed.
                </span>
                Two of the participants wanted to finish up the task given quickly that they completely ignored the notification. 
                <span class="italight-under">
                    To confirm they saw it, I asked them directly about it.
                </span>
                Both claimed they saw the bell, but they consciously decided that sending feedback was more important. Considering that setting the alerts and times are 
                an important part of diary studies, I opted to add an onboarding experience. The onboarding experience will guide users step by step to choose the type of 
                alert and different times of the day they want to be notified to create a diary entry. If later, they change their mind about the choices made, there is a 
                likelihood they would remember they have set up them before, and will realize that it might be a way to change them if needed.

                The standard alerts used are emails, text messages, and push notifications. However, for this particular use case time is a crucial part of the process, and emails are a slow way to notify someone about something that needs an immediate response. That is why I went with text messages, push notifications and decided to include an alarm option, because all three give the feeling of urgency  that an action has to be executed. This is an unusual way to use push notifications (typically they are sent by the app publisher in a time chosen by the publisher and not by the user), but push notifications provide a great advantage as well as alarms: 
                <span class="sm-bold-under">
                    they both guide the participant to the app to perform an action.

            <p class="smaller">
                I found no reason to change something users are accustom to, therefore, I decided to stick to a familiar look and feel, and this particular screen ended up being very similar to the Android alarm clock.

                During the usability testing, I noticed that participants either add a picture or a comment when the picture and description boxes are together in the same interface, 
                <span class="sm-bold-nodecor">
                    but never both
                </span>
                Someone even asked: “are they both mandatory?” Referring to the picture and comment features. Therefore, for the final design, I split it into different screens, meaning 
                that in order to move on with the process a picture/video needs to be added enabling the NEXT button.
            </br>
            In addition, if participants cannot  make an entry while eating they have the option to upload a picture from their personal files whenever they have the time to register an entry.
