        <p>PPR has two in-stores solutions: one made to print out labels/price signs in bulks 
            mainly for store managers, sometimes by retail associates (web-app solution) and 
            another one to correct or create tag prices on the go (usually very small batches 
            of signs created with a zebra scanner-phone size device).  This solution also has 
            a CMS that only was visible by system administrators.</p>

        <div class="Involvement">
            <p>For this particular project we user tested another’s designer work with both real customers (remotely) and paid participants
                with relevant experience. We recruited participants through an agency and brought them to Lexmark’s usability lab. My job was to provide the participant screener guidliness for the agency, design the user testing protocol, help running the usability testing, and address issues found
                during the usability testing. PPR is a revamp of AccessVia, which was acquired by Lexmark. During my time at Lexmark, 
                PPR was the most profitable software in the company’s portfolio services.

        <p class="some">Some of the main issues found were:<p>
        
        <div class="findings-flex">  
            <div class="findings">
                <p>Batches of signs were created for users and these batches were named automatically. 
                    Users were confused and could not find the batch they just had created and most of 
                    them did not even notice they created a batch to begin with, neither did they read the banner.</p>
                <div class="circle">

            <div class="findings">
                <p>Users had a hard time trying to find the product library. 
                    Users got stuck between the item library and the the “view batch.”  
                    The pages were alike, and it was hard for participants to know where they were.  
                    Some corporate participants suggested that the word create used in the item library implied something completely new. </p>
                    <div class="circle">
                        <h2>2</h2>

            </div>
            <div class="findings">
                <p>Most corporate users found the print IU had redundant information, 
                    that It was not clear what had been printed. 
                    Mainly because there was an animation pushing up an ongoing job, and replacing it with a new, 
                    therefore the print status was completely out of view. Users did not notice or understand how 
                    to select or deselect a sign from a group to print. Users did not know what the grey bubbles meant.</p>

                Instead, they went back and took other routes. When they finally landed on 
                the batch list they thought they were in the creating batches workflow, the
                main reason is because the two pages were similar.
                All this, added to a potential customer request that the items of 
                the item library (library of products) would have images let to the
